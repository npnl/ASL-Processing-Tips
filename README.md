ASL processing can also be complex. This package contains some hopefully useful tips for processing your pASL (pulsed ASL) task-related data in FSL FEAT, including de-noising an ASL resting state data set, by Dave and Lei, a text file with hints for your FEAT setup, and a pdf copy of the FSL FEAT Perfusion tutorial from the FSL website. It also contains a silly little Matlab script (ASLcontrolORtag.m) to easily figure out if your ASL sequence starts with a tag or control volume by Lei. A comparison of BOLD and ASL for the same design is coming soon! Requires Matlab, FSL.
